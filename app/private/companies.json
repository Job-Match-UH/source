      "description": "Aloha Air Cargo had its beginnings as a unit of Aloha Airlines, a passenger airline that served Hawaii and US mainland destinations from 1946 to 2008 for 61 years. Originally, Aloha’s cargo business consisted of carrying freight in the cargo holds below the floors of regular passenger flights. Aloha’s dual-purpose Boeing 737-200 QC aircraft, better known as ‘quick change’ aircraft, had the unique ability to convert from a passenger configuration to an exclusively cargo configuration in less than an hour. In the evening, pallets of seats were removed to accommodate the overnight cargo. On March 31, 2008, Aloha Airlines closed its doors, halting its passenger services. Aloha Airlines and its creditors, with the help of U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, sold the airline’s profitable cargo division to Seattle-based Saltchuk, which in turn operates multiple lines of business in the transportation, logistics and freight industries.",
