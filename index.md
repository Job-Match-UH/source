## Overview

### The problem
Many UH computer science and engineering students want to learn about internship and job opportunities, but currently they must wait until a company decides to visit the campus or send out some sort of announcement. There is no efficient way for students to understand the “landscape” of internship and job opportunities that might be available in the future, so they can prepare for them now.

### The solution
The Company Connector web application provides a new way for local and non-local companies who want to recruit students from UH to make their (potential) opportunities known to students. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests, experiences, and more. The site can match students to potential employers and vice-versa.

## Our Approach

Instead of sending out announcements each year, a company can create a page in the site that lists:

* A brief overview of the company.
* Geographic location of the company.
* A list of positions that they commonly recruit for from new UH graduates. Each position has a brief description, a set of skills, whether it’s an internship, permanent position, or both, how many people they would like to hire, and salary range.
* Links to the company’s main website for additional information.
* Contact email(s)/text messages for followup.
* Students who visit the site can create a profile with their interests (skills), preferred geographic location, and link to their professional portfolio page.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content and create new categories of skills and geographic locations.

## Developer Guide

The following will be used to create the app:

Meteor for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
React for component-based UI implementation and routing.
Semantic UI React CSS Framework for UI design.
Uniforms for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.



## User Guide

These are the mockup pages that will be used for the final project.

### Landing Page

The landing page is presented to users when they visit the top-level URL to the site.

Upon entering the site, users can:
* Login or Sign Up
* Read an About Us
